However, interactive data analysis in R is usually limited as the runtime is single-threaded and can only process data sets that fit in a single machine's memory.  SparkR, an R package initially developed at the AMPLab, provides an R frontend to Apache Spark and using Spark's distributed computation engine allows us to run large scale data analysis from the R shell.\nbaseurl: \"/scalable-machine-learning-with-sparkr\" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/\nurl: \"http://danielemaasit.com\" # the base hostname & protocol for your site\ntwitter_username: emaasit\ngithub_username:  emaasit\n\n# Build settings\nmarkdown: redcarpet\nhighlighter: pygments\n\nexclude: [\"CONTRIBUTING.md\", \"README.md\", \"book\", \"extras\"]\n\n\n",
