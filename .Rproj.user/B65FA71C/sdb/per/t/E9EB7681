With datasets rapidly growing in size and complexity, learning techniques are fast becoming a core component of large-scale data processing pipelines. This book introduces the underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines using SparkR.  SparkR, an R package initially developed at the AMPLab, provides an R frontend to Apache Spark and using Sparkâ€™s distributed computation engine allows us to run large scale data analysis from the R shell.\n\n<ul class=\"toc\">\n  {% include book-nav.html %}\n</ul>\n\n",
